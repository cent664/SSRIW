(Left) A sample 128x128x3 cover image from our subset of the imagenet validation set.
(Right) The watermark generated by resizing, isolating the first channel and binarizing the pixels which range from 0 to 255, to 0 or 1, based on the threshold 128 (half of 255).



**Watermark embedding location:**

Figure illustrating the pixels affected by the embedding process for each case by showcasing the difference between the cover image and their respective marked image. 



**Noise tolerance study:**

We perform an experiment to test the tolerance of our proposed scheme against increasing levels of noises. As expected the performance decreases steadily with an increase in the degree of noise.
